## Loading in data

I am loading in my instacart data, which will be used to make a flexdashboard of various visualizations of the data. 

```{r insta, message = FALSE}
data("instacart")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
